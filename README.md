# Proxy-List-Provider
While using internet services, the accessibility and usability of some content is restricted on the basis of your location. To overcome this situation proxies are used. The Servers which provide proxy feature are called proxy servers. Proxy servers act like a gateway between user and internet. It acts like an intermediate layer which separates the user and website. A proxy server intercepts the connection between sender and receiver which means all data entering via one port is forwarded to rest of the network via different port. This prevention from direct access between two networks provides extra protection from hackers.
